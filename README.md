## Installation

* Create new folder on your machine (e.g. Roam-css) and download site.css into that folder
* Open Roam in Chrome, display developer tools (F12)
* Select Sources > Overrides
* Select folder for overrides > Choose the new folder (e.g. Roam-css)
* Allow (when prompted "DevTools requests full access to ...")
* Go into Elements tab and change any item (e.g. body > font-size: 15px)
* Page may flicker - just refresh the page
* You now have a new folder in Roam-css
* Go into that new folder: roamresearch.com/assets/css/less-compile
* Replace the site.css file with the site.css file you downloaded from git
* If you prefer Bear's "red graphite" theme instead of "high contrast", then replace site.css with site - red graphite.css
* Refresh Roam page 

## Usage

* Changes will persist through browser refresh (may need to simply F12 > Refresh to pull in styling)
* When opening a new tab, F12 > Refresh page will load up styling
* To make any additional css changes, simply edit site.css, save, then refresh Roam page
* To remove this theme (and go back to Roam default), F12 > Sources > Overrides > Right-click folder > Remove folder form workspace > Refresh page



## Other Notes

* If you don't have Avenir Next fonts local on your machine, you'll need to add an import line or change the Avenir Next references to a local font you prefer.
